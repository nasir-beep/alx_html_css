In this project, I was tasked with building a web page from scratch without using any external libraries. The goal was to apply all previously learned concepts of HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design to create a fully functional and visually accurate replica of the provided design.

The instruction was to closely match the origin design by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX Designer. You may view the final design here: https://github.com/nasir-beep/alx_html_css.git
